Chest X-Ray (CXR) is the globally accepted standard for performing preliminary investigations of pulmonary ailments in a noninvasive manner.  After retrospective analysis of the various researches of our predecessors, we found that the number of CXR images used in the existing studies were quite limited, which may have led to “under-fitting of the data-hungry DL models“ This project is a preliminary step in the recognition and analysis of Human chest rays for COVID – 19 infections. We have trained various benchmarked Machine learning models to detect whether an X-Ray image is COVID or non-COVID.
